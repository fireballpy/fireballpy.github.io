**********

Fireballpy is a local-orbital Density Functional Theory (DFT) implementation for molecular dynamics simulations. This method facilitates the simulation and computation of extensive supercells containing thousands of atoms. The project is notable for its seamless integration with Python, enabling users to install and run simulations directly from Python scripts. Fireball, originally written in Fortran, has been coupled with a Python interface to enhance accessibility and usability for researchers and practitioners interested in local-orbital DFT-based molecular dynamics studies.
